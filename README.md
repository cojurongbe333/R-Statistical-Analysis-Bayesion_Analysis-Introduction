## üöÄ Getting Started

To render and explore these notebooks:

1. Clone the repository or download the `.qmd` files.
2. Open the files using **RStudio** with the **Quarto** extension installed.

Each notebook is self-contained and includes:
- Clean code with explanations
- Statistical methodology
- Visualizations (e.g., plots, histograms, scatterplots)
- Interpretations and conclusions

---

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and manipulation (using `dplyr`, `tidyr`)
- Statistical modeling (t-tests, ANOVA, regression)
- Visualization (`ggplot2`)
- Simulation and probability
- Reproducible research with **Quarto**

---

## üìå Notes

- All files are written in `.qmd` format and optimized for HTML rendering.
- For best experience, use RStudio with the Quarto extension.
